          <p> BT21 is composed of eight characters created by the members of the South Korean boy group BTS. Prince TATA who had been living on planet BT escaped from their royal kingdom as the restrictive lifestyle of their royal family prohibited their creative nature and free spirit. In their mission to spread love all throughout the galaxy, TATA travels to earth with VAN to become a star. In their journey, they meet six idiosyncratic members: RJ, KOYA, SHOOKY, MANG, CHIMMY, and COOKY to form the group 'BT21.' Together, they strive towards their dreams of becoming the most famous stars in the universe while simutaneously spreading love. </p>
